# Deep Compression
PyTorch Implementation of Deep Compression algorithm outlined here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.0014

Current to do list:
- [x] pruning below thresholds
- [ ] implement the quantization process
- [ ] extend SGD to be able to optimize with the quantized weights
- [ ] implement inference with quantized format
- [ ] huffman encoding 
- [ ] collate into usable modular sytem
- [ ] write a notebook outlining what's happening/ how to replicate
- [ ] try to replicate results from papers
